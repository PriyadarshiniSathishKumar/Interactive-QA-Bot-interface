# Interactive-QA-Bot-interface
The Interactive QA Bot is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, CSV, or text files) and ask questions based on the content of those files. The bot processes the documents and provides accurate answers, making it useful for information retrieval and analysis and is easily deployable using Docker.
